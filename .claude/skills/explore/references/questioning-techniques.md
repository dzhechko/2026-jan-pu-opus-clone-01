# Advanced Questioning Techniques

Reference for sophisticated question patterns when standard approaches don't yield clarity.

## Socratic Techniques

### Clarifying Questions
When answers are vague or use undefined terms:
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Can you give me a specific example of [concept]?"
- "How would you explain this to someone unfamiliar with your context?"

### Assumption Probing
When hidden assumptions might be distorting the problem:
- "What would have to be true for this approach to work?"
- "What are you taking for granted here that might not be true?"
- "If you were wrong about [assumption], how would that change things?"

### Consequence Exploration
When second-order effects matter:
- "If this succeeds, what problems might it create?"
- "Who might be affected that we haven't considered?"
- "What's the worst realistic outcome if this goes wrong?"

### Perspective Shifting
When stuck in one frame:
- "How would [competitor/user/skeptic] view this?"
- "If you had to argue against this approach, what would you say?"
- "What would you advise someone else in this situation?"

## Techniques for Specific Blockers

### When user presents solution as requirement
"I need a mobile app for X"

**Approach:** Trace back to underlying need
- "What problem would the mobile app solve?"
- "How do users handle this today without the app?"
- "If a mobile app wasn't an option, how else might you solve this?"

### When user can't articulate success
"I'll know it when I see it"

**Approach:** Use concrete scenarios
- "Imagine it's 6 months from now and this was a huge success—describe what's happening"
- "If you had to bet money on one metric improving, what would it be?"
- "What would your boss/customer/user say that would prove this worked?"

### When constraints seem impossible
"We need enterprise features but have startup budget"

**Approach:** Separate hard from soft constraints
- "If you had to prioritize: which constraint is truly immovable?"
- "What's the minimum viable version that would still be valuable?"
- "What could you trade off to make this feasible?"

### When user is emotionally invested
User seems attached to a specific solution

**Approach:** Validate, then explore
- "It sounds like you've thought about this a lot. What led you to this approach?"
- "What would make you reconsider this direction?"
- "What's the strongest argument against this that you've heard?"

### When multiple stakeholders with conflicting needs
"My boss wants X but users want Y"

**Approach:** Map the conflict explicitly
- "Let's map out who wants what. What does your boss's ideal outcome look like?"
- "Where exactly do these needs conflict?"
- "Is there a version that gives each party their most important thing?"

## Question Formulation Patterns

### The Magic Wand
Removes artificial constraints to reveal true desires:
"If you could wave a magic wand and have any outcome, what would you choose?"

### The Premortem
Surfaces hidden risks:
"Imagine this failed spectacularly—what went wrong?"

### The Constraint Inversion
Challenges assumptions about limitations:
"What if [constraint] wasn't a factor—would you approach this differently?"

### The Minimum Viable Success
Defines the essential core:
"What's the smallest version of this that would still be valuable?"

### The Regret Test
Clarifies priorities over time:
"In a year, what would you regret not having done?"

### The Opportunity Cost
Reveals trade-offs:
"What else could you do with the time/money/effort this would require?"

### The Outsider View
Escapes insider bias:
"How would you explain this problem to someone completely outside your industry?"

## Red Flags and Responses

| Red Flag | What It Might Mean | How to Probe |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|
| "Everyone knows..." | Unexamined assumption | "Help me understand—what's the evidence for this?" |
| "We've always done it this way" | Inertia, not strategy | "What originally drove this approach? Is that still true?" |
| "It's obvious that..." | Blind spot | "Walk me through why this is obvious—I want to make sure I understand" |
| "We just need to..." | Oversimplification | "What could go wrong with this approach?" |
| "ASAP" | Artificial urgency | "What specifically happens if this takes longer?" |
| No constraints mentioned | Hidden constraints | "What would disqualify a solution even if it technically works?" |
| Very specific solution stated | Solution fixation | "What problem does this solve? Are there other ways to solve it?" |

## Calibrating Question Depth

### Light Touch (1-2 questions per dimension)
Use when:
- User is experienced and already has clarity
- Task is straightforward
- Time is genuinely constrained
- User shows frustration

### Deep Exploration (3-5 questions per dimension)
Use when:
- High stakes decision
- Multiple stakeholders
- Technical complexity
- User seems uncertain
- Contradictions in answers

### Signs to Stop Questioning
- User is repeating themselves
- Answers are becoming terse
- You have enough for a clear brief
- User explicitly says "that's enough"
- Remaining questions are nice-to-know, not need-to-know

## Cultural Considerations

Some users may:
- View detailed questions as distrust
- Expect to define solutions themselves
- Be uncomfortable with "why" questions
- Prefer to give context incrementally

**Adaptive responses:**
- Frame questions as "helping me help you better"
- Acknowledge their expertise: "You know this space—help me understand..."
- Use "what" instead of "why" when appropriate
- Offer to explain why you're asking
